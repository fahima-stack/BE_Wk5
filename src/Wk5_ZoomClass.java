		//@23 mins Strings are immutable - when passed to a method, they don't change.
		//Everything else is mutable. Remember this! Or it will bite you in the butt. 
		//Use string unless it's in a loop that runs more than 30 times, otherwise use a StringBuilder on the outside of the loop. 
		//If you pass a string to a method, it's going to be the same as it was before, no matter what you do to it.
		//Use == for primitives and wrappers but .equals method for ... 
		// -> is the 'lambda operator' 
		//Reformat is ctrl shift F if code is going over space. 
		//.chars method returns an int stream but want to return a regular stream
		//.mapToObj converting int stream to String stream ==> need for Springboot
